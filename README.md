The inception of DiffLinesCounter was rooted in the necessity to assess the volume of code modifications prior to submitting a Pull Request (PR), ensuring that the PR remains streamlined and manageable. It's a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that offers a clear and concise view of the uncommitted changes in your project. With just a glance, you can see how many lines have been added or removed, and how many files have been altered since the last commit. This plugin is perfect for developers seeking immediate feedback on the alterations they are making to the code.

## Features üöÄ

- Displays the count of added and removed lines.
- Shows the number of modified files.
- Real-time updates as you modify the code.
- Click to manually update the line count.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Upon installation, a new widget will be displayed on the IntelliJ IDEA status bar. This widget will update automatically as you modify the code. If you wish, you can click on the widget to manually update the line count.
